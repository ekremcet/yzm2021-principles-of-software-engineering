# Why Do We Need Software Engineering Principles?

## Scenario 1: Working Alone

```python
# Personal project, quick and gets the job done
def calculate_grade(score):
    if score > 90: return "A"
    elif score > 80: return "B"
    # ... works for you, but what about others?
```
**What happens when...**
- Code grows to 10,000+ lines?
- You come back to it after 6 months?
- Someone else needs to understand it?

---

## Scenario 2: Working in a Team

<div class="two-columns">
<div class="column">

**Without Principles:**
- Everyone codes differently
- No shared understanding
- Integration nightmares
- "It works on my machine!"

</div>
<div class="column">

**With Principles:**
- Consistent coding standards
- Clear requirements
- Systematic processes
- Reliable, maintainable code

</div>
</div>

# Is there a definite solution?

![bg right 80%](assets/developer-cheatsheet.png)

- What happens to the code when the developer leaves?
- What happens when the **product owner** wants a change?
- Can we handle future feature requests in timely manner?
- Do we start fast and worry about it later, or worry about it now and code it later?
- Is that what the **user** wants?
- Is that what the **product owner** wants?
- Is that technically feasible?
- Does the business focus on **CAPEX** or **OPEX** ?
- How do we ensure consistent progress?

> Every single project is _unique_, the key is **to undrestand and to adapt**

# Small Project vs. Large Project

<div class="two-columns">
<div class="column">

## Small Project (5 developers, 3 months)

- Direct communication within the team
- Change requirements anytime
- Short life-span, code can be replaced
- Rely on existing SDKs
- Simple architecture
- Manual testing

</div>
<div class="column">

## Enterprise Project (50 developers, 2 years)

- Multiple stakeholders, complex communication
- Changing requirements = major cost
- Long life-span, the software must be future-proof
- Abstraction everywhere
- Complex architecture with many integrations
- Systematic testing, quality assurance

![bg right contain](assets/chaos-and-order.png)

# Why Software Engineering Matters

## The Software Crisis

- Projects over budget and behind schedule
- Software that doesn't meet requirements
- Difficult to maintain and modify
- Poor quality and reliability
- Not understanding the requirements of the user

## Software Engineering Solutions

- **Structured processes** and methodologies
- **Quality assurance** and testing
- **Project management** and planning
- **Documentation** and communication

# How Do We Make Decisions in Software Engineering?

### Every Decision Involves Trade-offs

<div class="two-columns">
<div class="column">

#### Speed
- **Fast Development**
- **High Performance**
- **Quick Deployment**

#### Security
- **Data Protection**
- **Access Control**
- **Vulnerability Prevention**

</div>
<div class="column">

#### Availability
- **Uptime Reliability**
- **Scalability**
- **Fault Tolerance**

### The Reality
**You can't optimize for all three simultaneously**

- More security = slower development
- Higher availability = more complexity
- Faster development = potential quality compromises

</div>
</div>

---

# It's 99% about the money

![bg right 80%](assets/developer-cost.png)

- Computing is cheap now (except GPUs)
- Each documentation costs developer time
- Each feature costs developer time
- Each optimization costs developer time
- That one last refactor will not boost sales
- Time is money

# Real-World Example: The $125 Million Bug

<div class="two-columns">
<div class="column">

## NASA Mars Climate Orbiter (1999)

- **The Problem:** Unit conversion error
- **Root Cause:** One team used metric, another used imperial
- **No Requirements Verification:** Nobody checked the units
- **Result:** $125 million spacecraft lost¬π

</div>
<div class="column">

## What Could Have Prevented This?

- **Clear Requirements Specification**
- **Interface Documentation**
- **Systematic Testing**
- **Code Reviews**

</div>
</div>

<!-- _footer: "NASA Safety Alert: [Mars Climate Orbiter Mishap Investigation](https://sma.nasa.gov/docs/default-source/safety-messages/safetymessage-2009-08-01-themarsclimateorbitermishap.pdf?sfvrsn=eaa1ef8_4)" -->

# Another Example: Therac-25

<!-- VISUAL: Medical equipment photo (radiation therapy machine) -->
<!-- OR: Timeline infographic showing the incidents -->
<!-- OR: Cause-and-effect fishbone diagram -->

![bg right contain](assets/thearc.webp)


- Medical linear accelerator (1985-1987)
- Used for cancer treatment
- Software-controlled radiation therapy

## What Went Wrong

- Race conditions in software
- Poor user interface design
- Inadequate testing
- No independent safety systems

## Consequences

- 6 patients received massive overdoses
- 3 deaths, others seriously injured

<!-- _footer: "Therac-25 Accidents: We Keep on Learning From Them - [https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/co/2024/12/10754612/21TGZa5l79e](https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/co/2024/12/10754612/21TGZa5l79e)" -->

# Lessons from NASA Orbitter and Therac-25

## Software Engineering Principles Violated

1. **Insufficient Testing**

   - No systematic testing of software
   - Previous hardware interlocks removed

2. **Poor Software Engineering Practices**

   - No formal requirements specification
   - Inadequate documentation

3. **Overconfidence in Software**
   - Removed hardware safety systems
   - Assumed software was reliable

# Software Engineering Fundamentals

<div class="two-columns">
<div class="column">

## 1. Abstraction
- Hide unnecessary complexity
- Focus on essential features
- Multiple levels of abstraction

## 2. Modularity
- Divide system into manageable parts
- Each module has specific responsibility
- Promotes reusability and maintainability

</div>
<div class="column">

## 3. Encapsulation
- Hide internal implementation details
- Provide well-defined interfaces
- Reduce coupling between components

## 4. Hierarchy
- Organize system in layers
- Higher levels use services of lower levels
- Examples: OSI model, software architecture layers

</div>
</div>

---

# The Abstraction Ladder

## From Hardware to High-Level Code

<div class="two-columns">
<div class="column">

### Hardware Level
- **Transistors** (0s and 1s)
- **Logic Gates** (AND, OR, NOT)
- **CPU Instructions** (MOV, ADD, JMP)

### Low-Level Software
- **Assembly Language** (MOV AX, BX)
- **Machine Code** (10101010...)
- **Operating System** (System calls)

</div>
<div class="column">

### High-Level Software
- **C/C++** (Pointers, memory management)
- **Python/Java** (Objects, garbage collection)
- **Frameworks** (React, Django, Spring)
- **Applications** (User interfaces, business logic)

## The Power of Abstraction
Each layer hides complexity from the layer above, allowing us to build increasingly sophisticated systems.

</div>
</div>

---

# Software Engineering Activities

<div class="two-columns">
<div class="column">

## 1. Software Specification
- Define what the system should do
- Requirements gathering and analysis
- System and software requirements

## 2. Software Design and Implementation
- Define system organization
- Implement system as executable programs

- Testing at all levels

## 4. Software Update
- Modify system to meet changing needs
- Maintenance and enhancement
- Software continues to change throughout its lifetime

</div>
</div>

---

# Software Process Models

## What is a Software Process?

- Set of activities and results in software production
- Four fundamental activities:
  1. **Specification** - what
  2. **Development** - how
  3. **Validation** - correct
  4. **Update** - change

## Process Models

- Abstract representations of software processes
- Different models for different types of software

---

# Key Software Process Models

![bg contain right](assets/waterfall-agile-ai.webp)

## Waterfall Model

- Sequential phases
- Each phase must be completed before next begins

## Agile Methods

- Iterative and incremental
- Start small and scale

## We'll explore these in detail in Weeks 3-4!

---

# Software Engineering Ethics and Responsibilities

<div class="two-columns">
